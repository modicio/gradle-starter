# gradle-starter

This project is a minimal gradle setup to use modicio in a Java project as documented in the [modicio wiki](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Getting started

* Clone this repository
* Get the modicio jar package see [modicio wiki](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Getting-Started)
* Add the path to the modicio jar in the ``build.gradle`` file as shown by the comment there
* The MainClass with some example code is ready to start.

> Note that explained [here](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Java-Integration), the Java wrapper does not posess JavaDoc. Instead, please refere to the mostly symmetrical Scala documentation part of the modicio wiki or [here](https://modicio.github.io/modicio-docs/)
